LearnHarness uses AI agents to plan and teach lessons from your current understanding to your goal. It builds a detailed picture of what you understand and how you reason. That picture is updated as you learn.

Instead of just giving you an explanation, it uses your answers and thinking to decide what you need next. Teaching builds understanding one reasoning step at a time. Practice makes it usable. A persistent knowledge graph carries it across sessions.

## How it works

1. **Measure.** Before teaching, the agent finds where your understanding ends on each part the lesson depends on. Your answers, confidence, and thinking show it where to start.
2. **Plan.** It works out a dependency map from that starting point to your goal. You can see the plan, and the lesson adapts when your understanding turns out different.
3. **Teach.** Each step builds on something you already understand. You predict, get an explanation, and check your understanding. Confusions are repaired before anything is built on them. The aim is for the goal to feel obviously true, not merely familiar.
4. **Practice.** Separate sessions pose varied problems that require the right knowledge to come to mind without being named first. Problems and hints adapt to your reasoning.

**Think out loud.** The thinking fields let you explain your reasoning, uncertainties, and reactions in your own words. This is how the agent gets a detailed picture rather than just a record of right and wrong answers. You can type or use dictation.

The agent can also research questions in the background, create visual explanations, and build interactive demonstrations.

## Knowledge that carries forward

What you are taught accumulates as propositions and reasoning chains: individual claims and the premises that lead to them. The graph shows this structure, with links back to the source sessions. You can also import notes.

Future teaching sessions can read the graph instead of starting from scratch. Practice sessions can draw their material from it. It stores the ideas and their connections, not ratings of your ability.

## Download and get started

**[Download from learnharness.ai](https://learnharness.ai)** · [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/learnharness/releases)

- **macOS (Apple Silicon):** signed and notarized DMG. Drag the app to Applications.
- **Windows (x64):** run the installer. It is currently unsigned; Windows may show an “unknown publisher” or SmartScreen warning.
- **Linux (x64):** make the AppImage executable and open it, or install the Debian/Ubuntu `.deb`.

Connect your ChatGPT subscription with **Sign in with ChatGPT**, or add a provider API key, then choose your models and start a session with what you want to understand. LearnHarness supports 30+ provider options, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter. Optional dictation and web search use separate service keys.

All three platforms support in-app updates.

### Use a ChatGPT / Codex subscription

1. Open model setup, or **Settings → Keys → Subscription**.
2. Select **Sign in with ChatGPT**, then **Continue sign-in in your browser**. No API key, OAuth app registration, or Codex CLI installation is required.
3. Finish signing in with an eligible ChatGPT account. When the browser and LearnHarness run on the same machine, the localhost callback completes automatically. Otherwise, paste the full final redirect URL into LearnHarness.
4. Select OpenAI models for the Strong, Cheap, and Vision slots. Available model access and usage limits depend on your account.

While connected, OpenAI requests use the subscription credentials instead of a saved OpenAI API key. Failed sign-in or token refresh does not silently fall back to API billing. **Disconnect** removes LearnHarness's saved subscription tokens; any API key remains available and becomes active again. Disconnect is local removal, not account-wide revocation.

This uses the pinned pi-ai library's ChatGPT OAuth flow. OpenAI controls eligibility and service availability. Cost figures elsewhere in the app are model-rate estimates, not a measurement of subscription charges or remaining plan allowance.

## Your keys, your data

- **Your keys and models.** No LearnHarness subscription or markup. Use an eligible ChatGPT subscription or pay providers directly through API keys; displayed model costs are estimates, not subscription billing.
- **Local storage.** Your chats, graph, settings, API keys, and subscription tokens live on your machine. Learning records are plain files you can inspect. Treat credential files like passwords.
- **External services.** Models run through your configured providers. Model requests send the context needed for the task; web research and dictation also contact external services. Local storage does not mean offline processing.
- **Inspectable behavior.** System prompts are visible and editable. The app is open source under the AGPL-3.0 license.

## Development and support

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm test           # deterministic, no LLM, no network
